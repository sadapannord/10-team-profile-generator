# Team Profile Generator
## Description 
In this challenge we were tasked with creating an application that would take a user's input of their employee's information. Once the user input all the employees they would like to add a HTML page would be generated with that information. 
During this exercise we were required to use Inquirer, and create tests using Jest to determine the functionality of our code. This challenge gave me a better understanding of Inquirer, as well as the usefulness of Classes.
